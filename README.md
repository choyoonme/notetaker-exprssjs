# notetaker-exprssjs

## Description

This application allows the user to take notes with titles and content, save them, and then delete as needed. It uses Express.js on the back end, connecting the front end code with the back end code and allowing input to get retrieved from a JSON file.  The application is deployed on Heroku.
